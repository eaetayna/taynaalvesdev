# Data Case Analysis

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis case developed using Python, focusing on data cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis, and business-oriented insights.
The objective is to demonstrate how raw datasets can be structured, analyzed, and translated into meaningful insights through well-documented and reproducible code.

## 📌 Project Overview

The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and validation
- Conversion and standardization of date and numeric fields
- Feature engineering for behavioral metrics
- Correlation analysis between key variables
- Visual exploration of patterns and relationships
- Insight generation based on data evidence

---

## 🛠️ Libraries

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Textwrap
- Os

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

- Correlation matrix to identify relationships between betting behavior, transaction time, and feedback
- Transaction time analysis by feedback type
- Odds versus total deposits analysis
- Time until first deposit analysis

All visualizations are automatically saved as `.png` files for reproducibility and reporting purposes.
